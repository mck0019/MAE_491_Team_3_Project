* Creates and runs a wireless access point labeled 'MAE491 Project Interface'
* Serves a webpage that interfaces the user with the system
* Runs a full state space controller

It is recommended to use the [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) to upload  the following files to the Raspberry Pi Pico W:
* ```bno055.py```
* ```bno055_base.py```
* ```math_util.py```
* ```web_util.py```
* ```main.py```

## Usage
Once the files are uploaded, the Raspberry Pi Pico W can be disconnected and installed into the system and will start automatically when the system is powered on.
